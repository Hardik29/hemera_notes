## Comprehensive Guide on Blockchain Classes and Their Usage

### 1. Token Transfer Classes

#### TokenTransfer
This class is a generic model for a token transfer event, which is later specialized into specific token types (e.g., ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155). It includes common transfer information such as the transaction hash, token addresses, and the value transferred.

**Attributes**:
- `transaction_hash`: The hash of the transaction.
- `log_index`: The index of the log entry within the block.
- `from_address`: The address that initiated the transfer.
- `to_address`: The recipient of the transfer.
- `token_id`: The ID of the token (optional for ERC20).
- `value`: The amount transferred (in tokens).
- `token_type`: The type of token (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155).
- `token_address`: The address of the token contract.
- `block_number`: The block number in which the transfer occurred.
- `block_hash`: The hash of the block.
- `block_timestamp`: The timestamp when the block was mined.

**Usage**:
- Use when dealing with any token transfer that is not specific to ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155.
- It acts as a generic representation of a token transfer event and can be further specialized.

#### ERC20TokenTransfer
This class models ERC20 token transfers, which are standard fungible tokens.

**Attributes**:
- Inherits all attributes from `TokenTransfer`.
- `value`: The amount of ERC20 tokens transferred (must be a positive integer).

**Usage**:
- Use this class when handling **ERC20 token transfers**.
- Typically used in functions that handle ERC20 transfers, where the `token_type` is set to `"ERC20"`.

---

#### ERC721TokenTransfer
This class models ERC721 token transfers, which are used for **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**.

**Attributes**:
- Inherits all attributes from `TokenTransfer`.
- `token_id`: The unique identifier for the transferred NFT.
- `value`: Not used as ERC721 tokens are non-fungible. The `value` attribute will often be `1` since each token is unique.

**Usage**:
- Use this class when handling **ERC721 token transfers**.
- Suitable for NFTs, as it requires the `token_id` to specify which unique token is being transferred.

---

#### ERC1155TokenTransfer
This class models ERC1155 token transfers, which are used for **multi-token standard** (both fungible and non-fungible tokens).

**Attributes**:
- Inherits all attributes from `TokenTransfer`.
- `token_id`: The ID of the transferred token.
- `value`: The amount transferred for this specific `token_id`. Can be greater than `1` for fungible tokens.

**Usage**:
- Use this class for **ERC1155 token transfers**, as it supports batch transfers.
- Suitable when working with both fungible and non-fungible tokens (since ERC1155 can represent both).

**Usage**:
- Use when tracking **internal contract transactions** and execution flow, especially when tracing contract interactions like calls and delegatecalls.
- Differentiates from normal transactions in that it is focused on the execution path within a contract, not the transaction itself.

- `transaction_type`: The type of the transaction (e.g., 0 for regular, 2 for EIP-1559).
- `input`: The input data for the transaction.
- `block_number`: The block number in which the transaction was included.
- `block_timestamp`: The block timestamp.
- `block_hash`: The block hash.
- `blob_versioned_hashes`: List of any versioned hashes.
- `max_fee_per_gas`: Maximum fee per gas for EIP-1559 transactions.
- `max_priority_fee_per_gas`: Maximum priority fee per gas.
