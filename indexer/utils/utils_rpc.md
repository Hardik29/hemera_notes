#
This utility code handles JSON-RPC responses from Ethereum nodes, focusing on request-response matching, error handling, and provider selection. Here's a breakdown:

## 1. Provider URI Selection:
```
def pick_random_provider_uri(provider_uri):
```
### What It Does:
Picks a random Ethereum node URL from a comma-separated list.
### Why:
If one node is down or slow, picking randomly helps with fault tolerance.

## 2. Batch Response Processing:
```
def rpc_response_batch_to_results(response):
```
### What It Does:
Loops through a batch of JSON-RPC responses and processes each using rpc_response_to_result.
### Why:
This supports batch requests, making RPC calls more efficient.

## 3. Response Handling and Error Checking:
```
def rpc_response_to_result(response):
```
### What It Does:
Extracts the result field from the JSON-RPC response.
### Error Cases:
If result is None and error is absent, the Ethereum node might be out of sync, so it raises a RetriableError.
If error exists, it decodes the error using decode_response_error.
### Why:
Ensures that invalid or incomplete responses are handled correctly, supporting retry logic.
## 4. Matching Requests and Responses:
```
def zip_rpc_response(requests, responses, index="request_id"):
```
### What It Does:
Matches each request with its corresponding response by request_id.
Uses a dictionary for fast lookups.
### Why:
Helps ensure correct matching of requests and responses in case of batch requests.


This code contains several helper functions to generate JSON-RPC requests for different Ethereum-related methods. Each function yields a JSON-RPC request in a format that can be sent to an Ethereum node. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the functions:

### 1. `generate_get_block_by_number_json_rpc(block_numbers, include_transactions)`

#### Purpose:
This function generates JSON-RPC requests for the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method, which retrieves a block by its number from the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Parameters:
- `block_numbers`: A list of block numbers to fetch.
- `include_transactions`: A boolean to specify whether to include transactions in the block response.

#### How It Works:
- The function yields a `generate_json_rpc` request for each block number.
- The request includes the block number (converted to hexadecimal using `hex(block_number)`) and the flag `include_transactions`.

#### Usage Example:
For example, calling this function with block numbers `[1000, 1001]` and `include_transactions=True` will generate two requests to retrieve these blocks with transaction data.


### 2. `generate_trace_block_by_number_json_rpc(block_numbers)`

#### Purpose:
This function generates JSON-RPC requests for the `debug_traceBlockByNumber` method, which is used to get the trace of a block's transactions.

#### Parameters:
- `block_numbers`: A list of block numbers for which the traces need to be fetched.

#### How It Works:
- Each request contains the block number (converted to hexadecimal) and a parameter for the tracer (`callTracer`), which is used for tracing all calls made during the block’s execution.
- The block number is used as the `request_id`, so it can be easily identified later when matching requests and responses.

#### Usage Example:
For example, calling this function with block numbers `[1000, 1001]` will generate two requests to retrieve the traces for these blocks.

### 3. `generate_get_receipt_json_rpc(transaction_hashes)`

#### Purpose:
This function generates JSON-RPC requests for the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` method, which retrieves the receipt of a transaction using its hash.

#### Parameters:
- `transaction_hashes`: A list of transaction hashes to fetch receipts for.

#### How It Works:
- Each request contains a transaction hash and an autogenerated `request_id` (using the index of the transaction in the list).
- This request is used to fetch transaction receipts, which contain data like gas used and logs emitted during the transaction.

### 4. `generate_get_code_json_rpc(contract_addresses, block="latest")`

#### Purpose:
This function generates JSON-RPC requests for the `eth_getCode` method, which retrieves the contract code stored at a particular address.

#### Parameters:
- `contract_addresses`: A list of contract addresses to fetch code for.
- `block`: The block at which to get the contract code (defaults to "latest").

#### How It Works:
- Each request contains a contract address and the block number (converted to hexadecimal if it’s an integer).
- The function generates a request to retrieve the code stored at the contract address.

---

### 5. `generate_get_balance_json_rpc(coin_addresses)`

#### Purpose:
This function generates JSON-RPC requests for the `eth_getBalance` method, which retrieves the balance of an Ethereum address at a specific block number.

#### Parameters:
- `coin_addresses`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:
  - `address`: The Ethereum address to check the balance for.
  - `block_number`: The block number at which to check the balance.
  - `request_id`: An identifier for the request.

#### How It Works:
- Each request contains the address and the block number (converted to hexadecimal).
- It generates a request to retrieve the balance of each Ethereum address at the specified block number.

---

### 6. `generate_eth_call_json_rpc(params)`

#### Purpose:
This function generates JSON-RPC requests for the `eth_call` method, which is used to execute a smart contract method locally (without broadcasting it to the blockchain).

#### Parameters:
- `params`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:
  - `param_to`: The contract address to interact with.
  - `param_data`: The encoded data for the method call.
  - `param_number`: The block number at which to execute the call.
  - `request_id`: An identifier for the request.

#### How It Works:
- Each request contains the contract address and encoded method data, along with the block number (formatted using `format_block_id`).
- The function generates a request to call the smart contract method at a specific block.

---

### 7. `generate_eth_call_json_rpc_without_block_number(params)`

#### Purpose:
This function is similar to the previous one but always uses the "latest" block for the `eth_call` method, ignoring any provided block number.

#### How It Works:
- Each request contains the contract address and encoded method data.
- The function generates a request to call the smart contract method at the latest block.

---

### 8. `generate_json_rpc(method, params, request_id=1)`

#### Purpose:
This is a helper function that generates a basic JSON-RPC request.

#### Parameters:
- `method`: The RPC method (e.g., `"eth_getBlockByNumber"`, `"eth_getBalance"`, etc.).
- `params`: The parameters for the RPC method.
- `request_id`: The unique request ID (defaults to `1`).

#### How It Works:
- This function generates a dictionary in the JSON-RPC 2.0 format, which is required for Ethereum node communication.
- The `id` field in the request helps match the response to the correct request.
